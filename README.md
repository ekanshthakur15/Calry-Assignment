# Calry Internship Assignment - Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to two algorithm-focused tasks for the Calry Internship Assignment. The tasks were implemented in Golang, and both tasks cover key problem-solving areas involving meeting scheduling and hotel room service API design.

The assignment tasks are as follows:
1. **Meeting Scheduler**: Optimizes meeting bookings by merging overlapping or consecutive time slots.
2. **Hotel Room Service API**: Provides a comprehensive set of APIs to manage hotel room service requests, including priority-based handling and status updates.

## About Me

I am a software engineering student with experience in building high-performance RESTful APIs and optimizing server-side architectures using Go, Gin-Gonic, Python, and Django Rest Framework. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at IIIT Dharwad, I have interned at IIIT Bangalore and Beanbyte Softwares, where I worked on API development, database management, communication systems integration and LLM integration. I am skilled in Python, Go, and web development, and I’m passionate about creating efficient, scalable backend solutions.
